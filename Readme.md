# Cimate-Change NFT

 Building a Dynamic and Interactive Climate-Change NFT which changes based on the current climate-related events which can be indicators of climate change.  
 
## Problem And Solution

 - The NFT will be fractionalized as it will reduce the carbon footprint happening due to multiple NFTs and transactions. 
 - The minters will be in shared ownership of the NFT and the Matic charged for the minting of NFT will be staked for rewards which will be donated for disaster-relief and other noble causes.
